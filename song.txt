May I take you higher
Feed well your desire
We won't be forgotten
Foes left slain and rotten

I will have my way as once before
Others stand in awe can't scorn at all

I can, I can, I can make it all again
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna go down
I can, I can, I can make the call again
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
I can
